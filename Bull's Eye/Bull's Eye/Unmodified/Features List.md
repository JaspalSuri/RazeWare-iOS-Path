# Features List

- Slider (1 - 100)
- a thumb for the slider
- a label on the left and right side of the slider to show the range
- Pop up with the score
- a label with the slider value
- a label with a string literal
- A button that checks the score
- a reset button (resets the rounds as well)
- labels for the score
- labels for the round
- a button that triggers something to present some information 
- a background
- theming of the buttons, thumbs, slider, etc.
What I missed
- saying "calculate X" instead of "add a button for X"
- generate a random number for the user to aim for at the start of each round
- put the app in landscape (it was in my mind and just seemed obvious)
- the range of the slider (I added it retroactively)
- I didn't distinguish the score and slider value (also fixed retroactively)
- The reset button also resets the rounds
